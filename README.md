# Tristan Martin — Personal Landing Page

A minimalist, interactive personal landing page serving as the central hub for my online presence and creative work.

## Purpose

A unified gateway that directs visitors to my creative and professional platforms through a clean, grid-based layout. Built with future scalability in mind for adding new links and projects.

## Features

- **Interactive Background Grid** — A full-screen HTML Canvas grid that reacts to mouse/touch input with a gravity-pull warp effect and dynamic orange color highlighting
- **Responsive 2×3 Grid Layout** — Headshot, bio, and link tiles that adapt between mobile and desktop
- **Retina-Ready Canvas** — High-DPI scaling ensures crisp rendering on all displays
