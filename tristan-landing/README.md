# Tristan Martin - Personal Hub

A highly aesthetic, creative micro-landing page serving as the central hub for my personal brand and online presence.

## Goal and Function

The goal of this website is to provide a unified, visually striking gateway that directs visitors to my various creative and professional platforms. 

Currently, the landing page includes links to:
- **Film Website:** [spatiallog.ca](https://spatiallog.ca)
- **Instagram:** [@_tristan.martin_](https://www.instagram.com/_tristan.martin_/)
- **LinkedIn:** [Tristan Martin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tristan-martin-ca/)

It is built with future scalability in mind, allowing more social, professional, and creative links to be seamlessly integrated as my personal brand evolves.

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with `create-next-app`.

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
